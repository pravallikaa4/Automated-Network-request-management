🚀 Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations in ServiceNow

This project introduces a structured and automated workflow in ServiceNow to simplify ticket assignment. By automatically routing issues to the right groups, it reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and improves resolution speed.

Enforcing security through roles and ACLs

Automating ticket routing using Flow Designer
